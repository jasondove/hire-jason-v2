# Thanks for stopping by.

Hi there. This is what's under the hood for [hirejasondove.com](http://hirejasondove.com). If you haven't guessed, 
I'm currently seeking employment as a frontend developer. If you're interested please feel free to get in touch!

The site itself is built with React + Vite + Typescript, with Firebase for deployment. I also got to play with a few
fun npm packages, like [Cobe](https://cobe.vercel.app/) and [use-scramble](https://www.use-scramble.dev/). Also, if you
have the chance, please check out my [hover-text](https://github.com/jasondove/hire-jason-v2/blob/main/src/components/hover-text/hover-text.module.scss#L1)
component to see how I used [Houdini](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Houdini_APIs) for my cool link
hover effects.
